## Iris dataset

Iris dataset contains data pertaining to iris flowers in which the features consist of four mesurements: petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The target variable encodes the species of flowers and there are three possibilities: versicolor, virginica and setosa.

As this is one of the datasets included in scikit-learn, we will import it from the scikit-learn and it will not be included in the project files.
